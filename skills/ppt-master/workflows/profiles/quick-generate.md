# Quick Generate Profile

> Generate-PPTX profile, not a top-level route. It removes the separate
> Strategist and confirmation phase; it does not remove the facts, resources,
> or export capabilities needed to build the final deck.

**Trigger**: the user explicitly requests quick/fast generation, asks to skip
strategy/confirmation, or directs the agent to proceed to SVG and export.
Page count alone never activates or blocks this profile.

## 1. Profile Boundary

| Concern | Quick Generate contract |
|---|---|
| Interaction | The current main agent decides content, design, resources, and implementation without Strategist, Confirm UI, or approval stops |
| Inputs | Any supported Generate input; convert/import sources and run bounded factual research when the input requires them |
| Resources | Prepare every project-local image, icon, formula, and required provenance/manifest artifact before the referencing SVG is authored |
| Planning artifacts | Do not create `design_spec.md`, `spec_lock.md`, confirmation payloads, or a second persisted strategy |
| Delivery | Hand-author the resolved SVG roster, run one lockless final checker, skip `finalize_svg.py`, and export the final native PPTX through `--quick-generate` |

**Hard rule — speed removes interaction, not material**: all ordinary source,
research, resource-preparation, analysis, and export capabilities remain
available when needed; the missing planning contract relaxes design constraints
only.

Explicit user facts, wording, choices, exclusions, and permission boundaries
still win. For every unspecified routine choice, decide directly and continue;
do not ask the user to approve a strategy or implementation detail.

After entry, continue through selected work, the final checker, and export.
Pause only for user interruption or an unresolved hard prerequisite.

**Default — optional production behavior (may override when useful)**: Speaker
notes, custom object animations, and narration start off. The current agent may
enable any ordinary capability when the request or deck benefits; use its
normal inputs, flags, and prerequisites without asking for approval. Quick
never creates or reads a Design Spec or lock to enable it.

**Mandatory — discover motion before deciding whether to load it**: scan this
compact gate once; do not load the full execution reference when the defaults
already fit.

| Signal | Action |
|---|---|
| The same semantic object or scene continues across adjacent pages | Load [`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md) before SVG authoring; prepare both visible endpoints and use its Morph contract |
| Page- or object-specific reveal, renewed emphasis, meaningful movement, or same-page removal clarifies the message | Load [`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md) before SVG authoring; preserve the required units/states, then run [`customize-animations`](../stages/customize-animations.md) after the final checker |
| One deck-wide entrance policy supplies all required staged reveal | Load [`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md) before export and use an exporter flag such as `-a auto`; do not run the custom stage |
| A directional/section boundary benefits from a non-default transition | Load [`animations.md`](../../references/animations.md) before export and select from its §3 playbook |
| No earlier signal applies | Keep `fade` transitions and object animation `none`; do not load the motion reference |

This gate activates capability discovery, not motion coverage. Keep the
defaults when no row supplies a concrete communication job. When several
signals apply, perform every required action and use the earliest required load
point; a before-authoring signal always overrides a before-export-only timing.

## 2. Source and Resource Preparation

Run [`generate-pptx.md`](../generate-pptx.md) Step 1 when applicable. Initialize
the minimal workspace with:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/project_manager.py init <project_name> \
  --format <format> --quick-generate
```

It creates only `svg_output/` and no root README. Add capability inputs only
when triggered; checker/exporter create `validation/`, `exports/`, and the
default-path `backup/`. With source files, continue with Step 2
`import-sources`; it creates the triggered input directories. Never scaffold a
Design Spec or lock. Use a new path, or verify that an existing path's
`svg_output/` is empty; Quick ignores any existing `design_spec.md` or
`spec_lock.md`.

Before writing P01, resolve in active context:

- the slide roster, canvas, visual direction, palette, typography, and wording;
- a transient resource roster with page, filename, purpose, visual intent,
  acquisition path, crop behavior, and status. For an image/formula, include
  its page relationship plus any subject position, focus, quiet region, or
  overlay-safety cue that must exist before SVG authoring;
- the implementation path for each resource. An explicit user path wins;
  otherwise choose the registered automatic/default path without another
  interaction.

Prepare only the resource paths that the roster triggers:

| Resource | Required preparation |
|---|---|
| Supplied/extracted image | Copy the selected file into `images/`; preserve its factual/provenance context and use the measured file rather than an invented substitute |
| Bundled/custom icon | Follow the [icon library contract](../../templates/icons/README.md), resolve the selected SVG under project `icons/`, and use `icon_sync.py` for bundled icons |
| Formula | Follow the [`latex_render.py` contract](../../scripts/docs/image.md), write `images/formula_manifest.json`, run the renderer, and keep the rendered PNG under `images/` |
| AI image | Follow `image-base.md` + `image-generator.md`; keep `image_prompts.json` and its human-readable sidecar |
| Web image | Follow `image-base.md` + `image-searcher.md`; keep query/status data and `image_sources.json`, including any required on-slide attribution |
| Illustration slice | Generate or obtain the parent sheet, run `slice_images.py`, and place only the resulting element files |

After image resources change, run `analyze_images.py` so
`analysis/image_analysis.csv` reflects the files that SVG authoring will use.
Operational manifests and provenance are resource truth, not a hidden design
strategy.

Every required resource must reach a usable terminal state before the
referencing page is authored. A required `Needs-Manual` resource blocks Quick
delivery even when an unverified candidate file exists. After a manual supply
or replacement, validate the file/provenance and reconcile the row to
`Generated`, `Sourced`, or `Rendered`; do not use file presence as a bypass or
silently replace it with unrelated material.

## 3. Direct SVG Authoring

Always read
[`shared-standards-core.md`](../../references/shared-standards-core.md),
[`svg-effects.md`](../../references/svg-effects.md), and
[`native-shape-authoring.md`](../../references/native-shape-authoring.md). Do
not load `executor-base.md`: its persisted-plan prerequisites do not apply to
this profile. For any image/formula, always read
[`executor-image.md`](../../references/executor-image.md),
[`image-layout-spec.md`](../../references/image-layout-spec.md),
[`image-layout-patterns.md`](../../references/image-layout-patterns.md), and
[`svg-image-embedding.md`](../../references/svg-image-embedding.md); add
[`executor-web-image.md`](../../references/executor-web-image.md) for a sourced
web image. Load [`canvas-formats.md`](../../references/canvas-formats.md) only
for a non-default canvas.

Use one zero-padded filename width sized for the resolved roster, such as
`01_cover.svg` through `12_end.svg` or `001_cover.svg` through `120_end.svg`.
Never reuse pages from another run: the exporter publishes every SVG discovered
under `svg_output/`.

**Canvas**: unless the user specifies another canvas, use `ppt169` with
`viewBox="0 0 1280 720"`. For another requested registered format, load
[`canvas-formats.md`](../../references/canvas-formats.md) and use its exact
viewBox. The first SVG establishes the export canvas; every remaining page must
match it exactly.

**Structure**: author flat, Slide-local SVG only. Include the complete visible
page and all resource references in each SVG; set one root
`data-pptx-page-role` from `cover`, `toc`, `section`, `content`, or `ending`,
and omit Master/Layout/layer/placeholder metadata.

**Typography**: name an installed concrete font family in the SVG; do not depend
on a lock or generated font asset.

**Generation pacing**: the current main agent hand-writes the SVG roster in
order. Use P01 as the visual anchor and continue directly through the remaining
pages without a first-page checker or confirmation stop. After the complete
roster exists, run the one final checker below. Apply other supporting tools
and stages only when their capability is actually needed.

---

## 4. Export

After every page and required referenced resource exists, run the lockless
final SVG check:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_quality_checker.py <project_path> \
  --quick-generate --stage final --json
```

Fix every blocking error and rerun the same command. Then export:

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/svg_to_pptx.py <project_path> --quick-generate
```

`--quick-generate` reads `svg_output/` as the page source and resolves the
project-local assets referenced by those SVGs. It infers one consistent canvas,
uses a lockless flat PowerPoint package, and does not force-disable ordinary
export options. Notes, custom object animation, and narration remain off unless
selected by the agent. Do not run `finalize_svg.py`.

The exporter requires a passing `final` report whose SVG fingerprint matches
the current `svg_output/`; missing, blocking, non-final, or stale reports stop
before PPTX creation. The default output path retains ordinary backup and
postflight behavior. An explicit `-o <path>.pptx` keeps the ordinary no-backup
behavior. On failure, repair the owning SVG, resource, or optional capability
input, rerun the final checker, then export again; do not create a Design Spec
or lock.
