## 1. Strategist Confirmation Stage

🚧 **GATE — whole-document authoring**: Generate Step 4 reads `templates/design_spec_reference.md`, writes the complete Design Spec from scratch, passes Gate 1, then reads `templates/spec_lock_reference.md` and writes the complete lock projection. For a new project, create each finished artifact once; do not instantiate or patch a placeholder scaffold. Run `project_manager.py validate`; the machine schemas, not remembered headings, own grammar validation.

⛔ **BLOCKING**: After the read, present professional recommendations for the confirmation fields below and wait for explicit user confirmation.

**Three-stage confirmation (the default Confirm UI flow; chat mirrors it).** The sequence is scene first, complete solution second, production third:

| Stage | Items | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — communication contract** | `c` audience · open-ended communication intent · audience outcome · core message / delivery context (primary + optional secondary) / artifact afterlife · `content_divergence` (all prose fields may be blank) · `a` canvas | confirmed first |
| **2 — complete deck solution** (authored once from the user's *actual* Stage 1) | reading mode (`delivery_purpose`, PPT only) · `d` mode + visual style · `b` page count · `e` color · `f` icon · `g` typography · `h` image source + generated-image rendering · conditional natural-language template application | derived from the confirmed contract; internal template exporter modes remain hidden |
| **3 — resources / production** (authored once from the user's *actual* Stage 1 + Stage 2) | formula policy · conditional AI-image acquisition path · generation mode · refine-spec toggle | derived from the confirmed solution |

Do not force communication intent into one catalog label; Stage 1 records composite intent in prose. Editable prose fields are recommendation drafts, not required inputs: confirmation preserves current text and blanks; never repopulate a cleared field. Stage 2 confirms narrative spine, reading density, page budget, visual system, and image direction. With a template, inspect its actual prototypes/content, present one editable application plan, and keep exporter reuse/adherence internal. Present ≥3 coordinated safe / shifted / bold directions so color, type, icons, and generated-image rendering begin coherent; the user may override each component. Generated images inherit deck colors—there is no second image palette. Stage 3 covers production. Author each stage once; same-stage edits update only visible browser state through documented deterministic dependencies, without another AI/backend recommendation. Launch/derive/wait mechanics live in [`generate-pptx.md`](../workflows/generate-pptx.md) Step 4; item specs keep `a`–`h`.

> **Execution discipline**: This is the last always-on BLOCKING checkpoint. After confirmation, proceed without another pause unless spec refinement is enabled.
>
> **One opt-in exception**: present the refinement line with the split-mode note ([`generate-pptx.md`](../workflows/generate-pptx.md) Step 4). Only explicit opt-in runs [`refine-spec`](../workflows/stages/refine-spec.md): write the Design Spec once, pass Gate 1, then stop before the lock for unrestricted chat revision. Never enter it unprompted.

> **Default presentation surface — Confirm UI.** Use `<project>/confirm_ui/recommendations.stage1.json`, `.stage2.json`, and `.stage3.json` at their documented handoffs and launch per Generate Step 4. The active, unconfirmed stage may be overwritten when the user asks for a new recommendation; normal progression writes the next stage file and leaves confirmed earlier stages intact. Stage 2 carries ≥3 safe / shifted / bold `design_directions`; each bundles visual style, a six-role HEX palette, CJK + Latin heading/body typography, icons, and conditional image rendering. Also print the recommendations + URL in chat as fallback context. Skip launch only for an explicit chat-only request; a chat-question tool is not a substitute. Generate Step 4 reads the final confirmed `result.json` once and retains that object for Design Spec authoring. [`confirm_ui.md`](../scripts/docs/confirm_ui.md) owns schema and lifecycle.

**Confirmed-value semantics**: confirmation preserves both the value and the owning field's semantic type. Apply the type to the affected property, not automatically to the whole object:

| Type | Consumption |
|---|---|
| Literal requirement | Preserve the exact contracted value, pixels, wording, or topology. |
| Semantic requirement | Preserve facts, relationships, intent, prohibitions, and completeness; expression may change. |
| Identity anchor | Keep recurring identity stable without creating an exhaustive allowlist. |
| Reference | Preserve the selected direction or role; adapt its realization to context. |
| Permission / default | An allowed candidate/source boundary or preference; Strategist may leave it unused, with no quota. |

**Authority chain — materials → Strategist preparation → realization.** User inputs set materials/acquisition bounds. Strategist owns sufficiency, gap-filling, and selection: roster/content, resources, chart/layout keys, fonts, palette anchors, icons, and crop bans. Fact research may precede confirmation; AI/web/slice follows final confirmation plus completed §VIII/lock; icons are synced/validated during authoring. Before Executor, each resource has a path and terminal/`Needs-Manual` state. Executor owns geometry, composition, hierarchy, spacing, treatment; it never searches, generates, syncs, invents, or substitutes resources. Missing material/reselection returns upstream. Specificity defines freedom; References flex realization, never selection.

Explicit *must*, *only*, *exactly*, *verbatim*, *do not*, or `no-crop` wording may strengthen only the named property into the appropriate Literal or Semantic requirement. Accepting an AI recommendation keeps the field's default type; it does not promote a Reference or Permission into a Literal requirement.

> ⛔ **GATE — final confirmation is consumed once into the Design Spec.** Use the complete final object already read by Generate Step 4 (`stage: final`, `status: confirmed`); on a chat path, use the final visible confirmation summary as the equivalent retained state. Do not reopen `result.json` during normal Design Spec or lock authoring. Consume every explicitly present field according to the semantics above and its field owner. Do not omit or substitute a value, and do not silently strengthen or weaken its type. Decide only details left unconfirmed; preserve an explicitly cleared prose field as empty. If a confirmed requirement cannot be honored, keep it visible and follow [`failure-recovery.md`](../workflows/governance/failure-recovery.md) instead of silently changing it.

### a. Canvas Format Confirmation

Recommend format based on scenario (see [`canvas-formats.md`](canvas-formats.md)).

### b. Page Count Confirmation

**Stage-2 planning input.** Confirm UI may hold an approximation/range; *exactly*, *1:1*, or preservation fixes it. After Stage 1, choose one exact count from source volume, audience outcome, delivery context/afterlife, and reading mode, then author the complete §IX roster. After Gate 1 and any enabled refine-spec approval, that roster's ids, count, and order—not the earlier UI wording—are invariant. Executor cannot add, drop, merge, split, or reorder pages; changes first repair or reconfirm the Design Spec.

### c. Communication Contract Confirmation

Seed the following as open-prose recommendations when the source and user request support an assessment. The user may retain, edit, or clear every editable field; the UI does not reduce the contract to a survey and does not require a non-empty answer:

| Field | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| `audience` | Who exactly must receive this communication, and what do they already know / care about? |
| `communication_intent` | What must the presentation accomplish? It may combine several purposes and state priority or sequence. |
| `audience_outcome` | What observable change means the communication succeeded — what will the audience know, understand, believe, decide, or do? |
| `core_message` | Which claim(s), decision ask(s), or action(s) must land even if little else is remembered? |
| `delivery_context` | What is primary—presenter-led, reader-led, hybrid, or recorded/self-running? For hybrid, which mode leads; what secondary use, occasion, and time constraint remain? |
| `artifact_afterlife` | What must the file support afterward — review, approval, audit, archive, hand-off, reuse, or no planned afterlife? |

**Delivery-context distinction**: Keep one open-prose field. Recommend a primary context and optional secondary use: presenter-led has a live presenter; reader-led must stand alone; hybrid names which one leads and what secondary use remains; recorded/self-running has no live presenter and relies on narration, timing, transitions, and playback. The user may clear it; do not replace it with an enum or add another field.

**Communication intent is open-ended.** Use *inform / explain / persuade / decide / align / teach / report and account / mobilize / record and hand off* only as prompts that help the user articulate an answer. Never render them as a checkbox list, radio group, or required single `primary_job`. When several purposes coexist, preserve their relationship in the prose (for example, “report progress and expose risk first; then obtain a decision on the next investment”). Do not silently collapse a composite answer into one label.

**Hard rule — confirmed current value wins.** Submit every Stage-1 prose field exactly as it appears when the user confirms. Blank means no explicit user constraint and may trigger downstream judgment from the source and request; keep the stored value blank and never restore the initial recommendation. A profile-declared `locked: true` field remains read-only and is the only exception.

The contract is not the narrative mode. `communication_intent` says what change is needed; `mode` is one Stage-2 strategy for organizing the argument. Several intents may share one dominant mode, and one intent may support several possible modes.

**Reading mode** (PPT only) is a closed Stage-2 information-carriage axis: `text` (read-close) / `balanced` (business, default) / `presentation`. Keep the existing `recommend.delivery_purpose` / `result.json.delivery_purpose` key for compatibility, but label and reason about it as reading mode—never as communication purpose. It decides how meaning is divided among the page, visuals, presenter, and notes, driving page grammar, granularity, density / rhythm, and the §b page-count recommendation. The §g body baseline is a downstream typography default, not the label or definition shown in the reading-mode control.

**Material divergence** — a **free-text** source-treatment intent in the Stage-1 delivery section: in their own words, how closely the deck should follow the source vs how freely it may reshape it. This is the user's own call — a free prose field (`content_divergence`), **not** a fixed set of options and **not** something you recommend from analyzing the source. Surface the question plainly (in the confirm UI it appears after the delivery-context fields); leave it for the user to fill. Blank = a balanced default.

Read the user's prose as a point on a spectrum and apply judgment — from *stay close* (track the source's structure and wording, tune only for clarity, no substantive add / drop) through the default *balanced* (re-architect and distill into a narrative under the locked `mode`, keeping all substance) to *free* (regroup, reframe, expand terse points, draw out connections latent in the source, invent section structure and transitions).

**Hard rule — facts stay sourced however free the user asks.** Divergence is freedom to *develop* what is in the source (reorganize / reframe / expand / connect), never licence to invent. Even the freest request must not introduce facts, figures, or claims from outside the source material — that is the `topic-research` job, not divergence. `mode` and divergence are orthogonal (e.g. a pyramid that hews to the source's own points vs. a pyramid built from freely synthesized themes).

**Fact provenance contract**: When `sources/*.facts.json` exists, read it before outlining and reference its stable `fact_id` values in every §IX page that uses an external quantitative or factual claim. Add `Fact IDs: F001, ...` to that page. Invented demo KPIs, internal ratios, targets, and roadmap numbers must instead carry `Data class: scenario`; never assign them an external `fact_id`. The same page may use both classes, but each number's class must remain unambiguous so Executor can place citations in notes/footnotes and visibly label scenario data.

When authoring §IX, translate every purpose named in `communication_intent` into an outline obligation. The rows below are a reasoning checklist, not a classifier; apply every relevant row and preserve the user's stated priority / sequence:

| Intent named in the prose | Outline must enable |
|---|---|
| Inform | Relevant facts with enough context to know why they matter |
| Explain | Mechanism, relationship, cause, or meaning made traceable |
| Persuade | Claim + evidence + material objections / alternatives |
| Decide | Explicit decision ask + options + criteria + trade-offs + consequence of delay |
| Align | Shared frame + priorities + owners + next steps |
| Teach | Prerequisites + sequence + worked application / check for understanding |
| Report and account | Baseline + progress + variance + evidence + risk + ownership |
| Mobilize | Urgency + agency + concrete action + immediate next step |
| Record and hand off | Context + decisions + status + owners + unresolved items + durable provenance |

**Material-divergence consumption — outline-authoring only.** Apply the user's stated divergence intent when authoring the `§IX` outline. Record the prose (or "balanced default") in `design_spec.md §I` (Content Strategy). Do **NOT** write it to `spec_lock.md`—it is baked into `§IX` at authoring time and the Executor never reads it. It carries no page-count coupling. Beautify seeds verbatim preservation and surfaces the field as locked/read-only; the server restores the locked value on every staged submit. Fill Native PPTX does not surface the field because that route is outside this confirmation flow.

### d. Style Objective Confirmation

**Stage 2 only.** Do not recommend or confirm any item in this section until the Stage-1 communication contract is confirmed. These are tools selected to serve the scenario, not substitutes for defining it.

Two independent layers, each locks one preset or `custom`. Output: `d. Mode: <mode> + Visual style: <visual_style>`.

> **Mandatory AI custom candidates.** Every `recommendations.stage2.json` carries visible, non-empty `custom_candidates.mode` and `.visual_style`, initially unselected unless the user supplied that exact direction. If a proposal combines or borrows catalog entries, read every named entry file before authoring the synthesis and name those exact ids in the visible proposal; a genuinely novel proposal needs no catalog reference. If selected, spell the proposal out in plain language and save literal `custom` plus the edited `mode_behavior` / `visual_style_behavior`; otherwise it remains recommendation-only. Never write bespoke prose as the enum value.

#### Layer 1 — Communication mode

🚧 **GATE**: read [`modes/_index.md`](./modes/_index.md) before recommending.

The deck's **narrative + persuasion skeleton** — how the argument is organized and advanced. Lock one preset from `pyramid` / `narrative` / `instructional` / `showcase` / `briefing`, or `custom` with behavior.

**Source**:
- User supplied their own outline / structure → preserve its facts and intended relationships, then apply the confirmed `content_divergence`. Treat an ordinary source outline as a Reference: regroup, reorder, or retitle when the communication contract benefits. Treat it as authoritative only when the user presents it as the final page plan or explicitly asks to preserve page order, titles, or wording; record that promoted boundary in `design_spec.md`. Still lock a mode for register, voice, and any permitted reshaping. `briefing` imposes the least if no particular "讲法" is intended.
- Beautify / re-layout profile ([`beautify-pptx.md`](../workflows/profiles/beautify-pptx.md)) → the extracted source content is authoritative and **verbatim**, one step stricter than the user-outline case above. Each source slide becomes exactly one `§IX` page in source order; transcribe every content block word-for-word — never reshape / re-primary / condense / merge / split / reword. Lock `mode: briefing`; color (e) and typography (g) are whatever the user confirmed in the beautify plan — the source identity (theme or observed) by default, or a content / brand-aware alternative the beautify plan offered and the user picked — locked as truth (the beautify plan already ran the recommendation through the confirm UI, so do not re-recommend here). Charts / tables / images are regenerated from their extracted data in the inherited style: record only selected catalog references in §VII, keep unmatched chart/table plans in their §IX page blocks, and route pictures to §VIII. Data values stay frozen and the rendering is the deck's own; visuals are never carried over verbatim. Layout, hierarchy, rhythm, and visual rendering are what gets redesigned.
- A bespoke direction the five don't give — a nameable cadence (dialectic 正反合, myth-vs-reality, countdown, Socratic), a multi-act fusion of modes, or the user's own feel (confrontational here, detached there). Either the user asks, **or you recommend it** when a fusion / bespoke direction genuinely serves the deck better than a single preset (a recommendation the user confirms, like every lock). The *kind* doesn't matter → `mode: custom` + a `mode_behavior:` paragraph that **crystallizes the intent** (act sequence or posture shifts, title voice, page rhythm, register) concretely enough for the Executor to follow per page; it reads only `spec_lock.md`, never the chat. If the direction uses existing modes, read every corresponding `modes/<id>.md` before synthesis and retain those exact ids as its catalog basis; if it is genuinely new, do not invent a basis. One deck locks **one** value — a fusion is one `custom` describing the acts, never several modes. Avoid only the *dodge*: don't default to `custom` when a preset genuinely fits, and prefer a dominant mode + page-level variation when one mode leads.
- No user structure or cadence → recommend from the confirmed `communication_intent`, `audience_outcome`, source texture, and delivery context using the index's auto-selection table. Composite intent does not automatically require `custom`: choose the dominant spine of the body pages when one exists; use a concrete `custom` act sequence only when no single spine can serve the stated priority / sequence. Present as a recommendation; the user may override.

Record the confirmed mode and rationale in `design_spec.md` first, including the exact catalog basis when a selected custom uses one. Then project `- mode:` to `spec_lock.md`; for `custom`, also project `- mode_behavior:` and, only when catalog material is actually used, `- mode_references: <id>, <id>`. Executor reads one file for a preset. For `custom`, it reads every listed reference before applying the behavior; an unreferenced novel custom follows the behavior directly.

#### Layer 2 — Visual style

🚧 **GATE**: read [`visual-styles/_index.md`](./visual-styles/_index.md) before recommending.

The deck's **visual aesthetic** — shape language, decoration density, whitespace rhythm, typographic character, texture. Anchors downstream fields e (Color), f (Icon), g (Typography), h (Image). Lock one preset from the catalog, or `custom`.

**Source**:
- User named a style (chat / template / beautify) → it is truth: map to the closest preset (or `custom` with a `visual_style_behavior` paragraph) and lock directly. **Skip the spectrum below** — do not re-offer choice they already made.
- No user description → **present a personality spectrum, not one safe pick** (this is the lever against "every deck looks the same" — the visual style is what most determines a deck's character, so it gets real choice, like the alternative-set rule used for image rendering). Author **≥3 distinct styles** from the index's auto-selection table spanning *safe* (the industry-norm recommendation) → *shifted* (an alternate one tick more expressive) → *bold* (a characterful style that challenges the default — `brutalist` / `zine` / `memphis` / `ink-wash` / `vintage-poster` etc., whenever the content can carry it). Give each a one-line **temperament tag + real-world analogy** (for example, "like an Economist feature"). Write the three to `recommendations.stage2.json` `visual_style_spectrum` (each `{id, tag_zh/en/ja, note_zh/en/ja}` — include the `_ja` variants whenever the page `lang` is `ja`) **and present the same three in chat** as the always-valid fallback; set `recommend.visual_style` to the *safe* pick as the pre-selected default. The user may pick any of the three or the separate full-copy Custom proposal. Honest-shortfall may reduce the preset set, never remove Custom.

**Forbidden — a non-catalog name as `visual_style`**: the value MUST be an `id` from the visual-styles catalog or literal `custom`; bespoke prose belongs only in `visual_style_behavior`. A name that is **not** in that catalog is not a visual style — most often it is an image-rendering name from the `_index` "Paired rendering" column (`flat`, `vector-illustration`, `digital-dashboard`, `3d-isometric`, `corporate-photo`, …), which names the §h *illustration* family, not the deck's layout aesthetic. Do not borrow it. (Names that are intentionally **both** a style and its paired rendering — `glassmorphism`, `blueprint`, `editorial`, `dark-tech` — are valid styles because they *are* in the catalog.) Generic baseline words — `flat` / flat-design / 扁平 / modern / clean / simple / minimal — are **not** custom-worthy either: the whole system is flat by default (shadows discouraged), so map them to the closest preset (flat + grid → `swiss-minimal`; flat + rounded → `soft-rounded`; flat + dense → `brutalist`). Reserve a custom lock for an aesthetic no preset covers; the mandatory candidate does not make it the default.

**Carries no color.** A visual style governs how the deck's HEX (locked at `e`) is *used* — never which colors, same discipline as [`image-renderings`](./image-renderings/_index.md). When the deck has AI images, prefer the style's paired rendering so layout and illustration share one aesthetic.

Record the confirmed visual style and rationale in `design_spec.md` first, including the exact catalog basis when a selected custom uses one. Then project `- visual_style:` to `spec_lock.md`; for `custom`, also project `- visual_style_behavior:` and, only when catalog material is actually used, `- visual_style_references: <id>, <id>`. Executor reads one file for a preset. For `custom`, it reads every listed reference before applying the behavior; an unreferenced novel custom follows the behavior directly.

**Conditional template workspace**: When Generate Step 3 installed an explicit workspace path into `<project_path>/templates/`, read [`strategist-template.md`](./strategist-template.md) before completing Stage 2. It owns the editable natural-language application plan, confirmed-value consumption, AI-authored prototype selection, internal reuse/adherence derivation, inherited design precedence, and structured-lock planning. Bare names, style words, and free-design projects do not trigger it.

**Downstream effect**: e / f / g / h realize the locked mode + visual style. Example: `showcase` + `dark-tech` → e applies one luminous accent on a dark field; g pairs a clean sans with mono; f minimal glow icons; h the `digital-dashboard` rendering.

### e. Color Scheme Recommendation

**Hard rule**: User-specified colors are truth. Lock supplied HEX, brand colors, or natural-language directives; templates follow inherited-design precedence. Even direct locks fill all six roles (`background`, `secondary_bg`, `primary`, `accent`, `secondary_accent`, `body_text`) in each of ≥3 directions: repeat fixed roles and vary only open ones. Never emit an empty palette. Keep body-text contrast at least 4.5:1 and preserve confirmed/brand semantic roles.

**Reference — not a constraint**: Without user/template colors, propose project-specific directions from content and style. `scripts/config.py` industry colors and dominant/support/accent hierarchy are recall aids, never default locks, ratios, or color-count quotas.

**Lock recurring semantic anchors, not every possible paint.** Add the neutral roles already known to recur across the deck—such as `surface`, `grid`, `scrim`, `overlay`, or `block-shade`—when the visual style and page plan establish a stable meaning for them. Do not try to predict every page-local tint, gradient stop, shadow/glow color, transparency composite, or one-off illustration tone. Those values are chosen from page context during execution; promote one into `spec_lock.colors` only when it becomes a reusable named role.

| Style trait | Extra neutral tiers to lock |
|---|---|
| Layers panels / charts (e.g. `data-journalism`, `swiss-minimal`) | `surface` (panel lift), `grid` (hairline, lighter than dividers) |
| Text over imagery / dark field (e.g. `photo-editorial`, `glassmorphism`, `dark-tech`) | `scrim` / `overlay` for legibility |
| Print / hand-drawn fills (e.g. `chalkboard`, `zine`) | `block-shade`, one step off the field |

### f. Icon Usage Confirmation

| Option | Approach | Suitable Scenarios |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **A** | Emoji | Casual, playful, social media |
| **B** | AI-generated | Custom style needed |
| **C** | Built-in icon library | Professional scenarios (recommended) |
| **D** | Custom icons | Has brand assets |

The built-in icon library contains multiple stylistic libraries plus a brand-logo library:

See [`../templates/icons/README.md`](../templates/icons/README.md) for the current library inventory, counts, prefixes, and SVG placeholder details.

> **Mandatory rules when choosing C**:
>
> **At the Strategist confirmation stage — decide the library and stroke only; resolve and sync filenames after approval.**
>
> 1. **Pick at most one primary stylistic library from the four bundled choices** — when generic icons are needed, read the source material and choose the one whose visual character best serves the deck:
>    - **`chunk-filled`** — fill, straight-line geometry (M/L/H/V/Z only); sharp right angles; heavy, solid, architectural
>    - **`tabler-filled`** — fill, bezier curves and arcs (C/A); smooth, rounded, organic; medium weight, approachable
>    - **`tabler-outline`** — stroke (line art); airy, refined, lightweight; best for screen-only (thin strokes may be hard to read in print)
>    - **`phosphor-duotone`** — duotone; main shape + 20% opacity backplate; medium weight, layered, contemporary
>    - During bundled-library selection, do not select generic icons from more than one of `chunk-filled` / `tabler-filled` / `tabler-outline` / `phosphor-duotone`. If the chosen library lacks an exact icon, find the closest alternative **within that same library**.
>    - **`simple-icons` may be selected alone or alongside the primary library**: it is a brand-logo library, not one of the four stylistic choices. Add it only for real company / product / service marks (customer logos, tech-stack icons, social handles), never as a substitute for a missing generic icon.
>    - This restriction governs Strategist selection from the bundled catalog, not the prepared project asset pool. User-provided, template-carried, imported, custom, and previously prepared files under `<project_path>/icons/` remain valid material regardless of namespace or visual style.
> 2. **Stroke weight lock (stroke-style libraries only)** — for stroke-based libraries (currently `tabler-outline`), pick one deck-wide value from `{1.5, 2, 3}` (default `2`). For heavier presence, switch library instead of going above `3`.
>
> **After the Strategist confirmation stage is approved — when writing `design_spec.md` §VI / `spec_lock.md`**, then materialize the icon inventory:
>
> 3. Enumerate only the concepts required by the confirmed outline.
> 4. Put known basenames in the final batch. For an uncertain one, search the chosen style library — or `simple-icons` for a real brand mark — with `rg --files "skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/<library>" -g '*<keyword>*.svg'`; do not enumerate broad keyword families.
> 5. **Copy and validate in one batch** — run `python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/icon_sync.py <project_path> <lib/name> [<lib/name> …]`. This both validates and materializes `<project>/icons/<lib>/`; skip per-file prechecks.
> 6. Keep each successful, case-sensitive `lib/name`: bundled basenames are lowercase (`tabler-outline/award`, never `tabler-outline/Award`); custom icons retain exact case.
> 7. Record the successful bundled selection, its primary stylistic library, and any stroke-library `stroke_width` in `design_spec.md` §VI and `spec_lock.md icons`. Keep selected `simple-icons/*` ids in the same inventory without treating them as a second stylistic library. The inventory records the plan; it does not revoke other prepared project-local icons.
>
> 🚧 **GATE — missing icon = re-pick now**: on non-zero exit, search a missing generic concept only in the chosen stylistic library, or a missing real brand mark in `simple-icons`; re-pick and rerun the final batch until clean. Never carry a missing icon forward or switch among the four stylistic libraries to fill the gap.
>
> **Default — targeted lookup only**: do not load or rebuild a full index; search only unresolved concepts.

### g. Typography Plan Confirmation (Font + Size)

🚧 **GATE**: Read the locked preset visual-style file's §2 Typography character before recommending type. For a custom style, first read every file in `visual_style_references` when present, then resolve their typography character under `visual_style_behavior`; a novel custom uses the behavior directly. The title carries the character; the body may remain neutral.

**Family selection**:

- User or active template typography is authoritative. Otherwise ≥3 Stage-2 directions include concord (safe) and contrast (tension); never add a separate font-choice round or pair near-duplicate title/body families.
- Every Stage-2 direction carries `heading` / `body` `cjk`, `latin`, `css`, and positive `body_size`; repeat user/template-fixed stacks.
- Use PowerPoint-installed exported faces. Safe anchors: CJK `Microsoft YaHei` / `SimHei` / `SimSun` / `FangSong` / `KaiTi`; Latin sans `Arial` / `Calibri` / `Segoe UI` / `Verdana` / `Trebuchet MS`; Latin serif `Times New Roman` / `Georgia` / `Cambria` / `Garamond` / `Book Antiqua`; mono `Consolas` / `Courier New`; display `Impact` / `Arial Black`. Other export-safe families are limited to sparse short display/ornament; structural or recurring use returns upstream.
- Keep each stack to four families or fewer. A non-installed brand or web face is legal only when the Design Spec explicitly records the install / embed requirement and a safe substitute.
- Avoid splitting roles across near-equivalents such as YaHei↔PingFang, SimSun↔Songti, Arial↔Helvetica↔Segoe UI, or Times New Roman↔Times. A cross-platform counterpart may remain inside one fallback stack.
- Choose by locked style and vary the axis instead of defaulting to YaHei/Arial: serif×sans, Kai/FangSong×hei, hei×song, double-serif, display×neutral, same-family weight, or sans+mono. These are recall seeds, not presets.

**Strategist-owned role extension after confirmation**: Confirm UI keeps the heading/body choice unchanged. While authoring the complete §IX roster and §IV typography plan, scan the actual content for recurring roles that materially need a different family for character or legibility—such as `annotation`, `footer`, `footnote`, `data`, `emphasis`, `quote`, or `code`. Add a lowercase snake_case role and exact stack only when it recurs; inherited roles and one-off garnish stay omitted. The extension must remain coherent with the confirmed heading/body system and locked visual style, and it does not reopen confirmation. Only when an additional family role is added, record one compact `Role rationale` in §IV naming the added role(s) and why; otherwise omit the line.

**Size anchors — px only**: Every authoring layer carries bare px numbers. PowerPoint's displayed pt is an export result (`px × 0.75`), never an input or confirmation value.

| Reading mode on PPT | Initial body | Information posture |
|---|---:|---|
| `text` | 20 | read-close / dense |
| `balanced` | 24 | mixed reading + presentation |
| `presentation` | 32 | projected / sparse |

Other canvases use the body baseline in [`canvas-formats.md`](canvas-formats.md). The confirmed role-anchor values always win: take Confirm UI `body_size` / `sizes` verbatim as anchors; a manually edited anchor remains pinned, and changing canvas does not secretly rescale it.

| Recurring role | Ratio to body |
|---|---:|
| Cover title / single-focus hero | 2.5–5× |
| Chapter title | 2–2.5× |
| Page title / KPI hero | 1.5–2× |
| Subtitle | 1.2–1.5× |
| Lead / subheading | 1.1–1.4× |
| Body | 1× |
| Annotation | 0.7–0.85× |
| Footnote / page number | 0.5–0.65× |

Scan §IX before locking. Declare every recurring role, including `lead`, `footnote`, and chart annotations when used; a lead is always at least body size. Give each role one deck-wide anchor and snap derived anchors to clean even px (for body 24, a sound set is title 42, subtitle 32, lead 30, annotation 18, footnote 16). Executor may vary one occurrence within that role's anchor ±2px while preserving hierarchy and readability. A short non-structural Hero/Display size planned for at most two occurrences may remain undeclared; the third planned occurrence makes it recurring and requires an explicit named slot. Structural text never uses this sparse exception.
#### Formula Planning Trigger

Formula policy and formula-asset planning are conditional. If the source contains formula-worthy expressions, or the user explicitly requests formula handling, read [`strategist-image.md`](./strategist-image.md) §3 before confirming the production policy or writing formula rows. Load it even when `image_usage` is `none`; otherwise omit formula planning from the core path.

### h. Image Source Recommendation

| Source id | Approach | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | No images | Data reports or process documentation whose visual burden is fully served by charts / native SVG |
| `provided` | User-provided assets | Existing images carry factual, brand, product, or narrative authority |
| `ai` | AI-generated | Custom illustrations, backgrounds, metaphors, or a coherent spot family are needed |
| `web` | Web-sourced | Real-world editorial or stock-style reference imagery is needed |
| `placeholder` | Deferred | The image is required but will be supplied later |

**Current inventory**: If `images/` is non-empty, run `python3 scripts/analyze_images.py <project_path>/images` and read `analysis/image_analysis.csv` before recommending a source. Re-run after that folder changes.

**Recommendation output**: Write `recommend.image_usage` as one source id or an array for mixed sources. Put page roles, authoritative assets, preferred/avoided imagery, and placeholder tolerance in `image_notes.value`. `none` is exclusive. Human-scale topics such as family life, education, wellness, or children lean `ai` when no supplied asset carries the story; regulated investor decks, B2B finance reports, and data-only dashboards remain eligible for `none` by judgment.

**Confirmed value wins**: Accept the confirmed legacy string or multi-select array. Map `ai→ai`, `web→web`, `provided→user`, and `placeholder→placeholder` into §VIII `Acquire Via`. Until confirmation, a coordinated direction that proposes AI may use the visual style's paired rendering; generated images inherit the deck colors and never introduce a second image-palette choice.

**Conditional module — two-stage trigger**:

1. First derive the proposed `recommend.image_usage` in core. If it contains any non-`none` source—especially `ai`—read [`strategist-image.md`](./strategist-image.md) **before authoring the Stage-2 design directions** so rendering and other image-dependent candidate details are real, not backfilled after confirmation. An explicit non-`none` image constraint or the formula trigger from §g activates the module at the same point.
2. After confirmation, the confirmed value is the production boundary. A confirmed non-`none` set continues into resource planning; confirmed `none` with no formula trigger skips all downstream image rows even if the proposed recommendation had loaded the module.

The module owns formula policy, AI rendering alternatives, acquisition paths, resource rows, prompt depth, page roles, and placement intent.

### Presentation Capability & Visualization Recall (Non-blocking — Strategist recommends, no user confirmation needed)

**Per-page capability recall**: Before finalizing §IX, consider the short menu
below. Select only capabilities that strengthen the page's communication or
visual expression; no page or deck owes a usage quota. Record semantic intent
in existing Design Spec fields, never commands, coordinates, group ids, or
effect parameters. Omit unused recommendation lines instead of writing `none`.
Executor owns realization under the receiving capability contract and may adapt
or decline the two non-literal §IX suggestion lines while preserving content
and intent; explicit user/template requirements remain binding.

| Capability | Opportunity signal | Design Spec handoff |
|---|---|---|
| Image composition | Image-as-canvas plus native overlay, editorial crop, collage, cutout, or independently meaningful focus / comparison / evidence units carry the page better than an adjacent rectangle | Propose a permitted image source; when selected, load [`strategist-image.md`](./strategist-image.md), record each resource's exact catalog §VIII `Layout pattern`, and describe the page-level image/overlay relationship in §IX `Layout` / `Images` |
| Native shape / Merge Shapes | A literal Office symbol, a stock bent/curved relationship contour, or a compound silhouette, negative-space cutout, overlap-only region, or meaningful fragmentation strengthens the visual idea | Add an optional §IX `Native shape suggestion` with the semantic result plus a candidate preset/Connector family or Boolean operation/operands |
| Page transition | A section/state change, spatial continuity, recorded/self-running flow, or the same semantic object changing position, scale, crop, or state across adjacent pages benefits from motion | Add an optional §IX `Motion suggestion` describing the communication job and any continuing object's start/end semantic states; leave effect, ids, pairing names, and timing to Executor |
| Object animation | Progressive reveal clarifies sequence, causality, comparison, hierarchy, narration order, full-view → detail, atmosphere → evidence, or hotspot/annotation order | Add an optional §IX `Motion suggestion` describing semantic units/order and any visible image-state relationship; leave group ids, effect, and timing to Executor |

Review planned pages through two lenses:

| Lens | Content shapes |
|---|---|
| Numeric / data | comparisons, trends, proportions, KPIs, financials, rankings, distributions, funnels |
| Structural information | rosters, agendas, principles, phases, journeys, capability maps, OKR cascades, roadmaps, strategic frameworks |

**Per-page recall**: For every page whose information structure may benefit from a visualization, restate the content shape as 3–8 concise English semantic tags. Translate source-language and industry terms into structure before recall. Run:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/chart_recall.py recall \
  --page P03 \
  --tag "time series" \
  --tag "three metrics" \
  --tag "direction over time" \
  --limit 6
```

The command returns a bounded shortlist plus `no-template-match`. Read it unfiltered; `tail` / `head` / `grep` can hide ranked candidates. `confidence` is lexical only. At `high` / `medium`, keep no-match after candidate review. At `low` / `none`, use a fitting candidate directly; otherwise rerun once with `--semantic-fallback` before no-match. Do not open a second index.

**Selection**:

1. Choose the most relevant candidate as a reference for that page. It does not lock the final visualization type or geometry and never applies to another page without its own row.
2. After the fallback gate above, retain `no-template-match` when no reference fits: data content falls back to a table, permitted conceptual content to an AI image, and structural content to a custom layout. Record the fallback only in the page's §IX `Visualization` / `Layout`; never serialize it into §VII.
3. Validate all selected keys before writing the lock:

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/chart_recall.py validate <key> [<key> ...]
```

A failed validation must be corrected with a recalled key. `no-template-match` is not a key and never appears in `page_charts`.

**Section VII selection list**: when a reference is selected, write `Page | Template | Usage`; Usage is one short page-local purpose, not geometry. Omit §VII when none is selected, and never add path, summary, runners-up, `no-template-match`, or `n/a`. §IX remains authoritative.

**Native-ready boundary**: For every independent data chart or pure text-grid table, add `Native-ready: yes|no` to its §IX page block. Choose `yes` only when the confirmed requirement or artifact afterlife benefits from an editable native data object; otherwise keep the designed SVG with `no`. Conceptual rows and incidental sparklines, KPI trends, or insets omit the field; Executor never promotes them.

```markdown
| Page | Template | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P03 | line_chart | Compare the source metrics over time |
```

**Native-geometry candidate detail**: Add `Native shape suggestion` to the
affected §IX page when the content calls for a literal stock PowerPoint
chevron, block arrow, standard flowchart node, callout, banner, star, or a
stock bent/curved Connector contour. Describe a relationship by its semantic
route and candidate family, not an exact preset key, endpoint/site metadata, or
attachment promise. For a compound silhouette, cutout, common region, or
meaningful fragmentation, name the candidate Union / Combine / Fragment /
Intersect / Subtract operation, semantic operands, and intended result.
Executor still decides the exact basic primitive, preset, Boolean construction,
or necessary freeform under its native-shape branch; the recommendation never
creates a §VII row or lock field.

### Speaker Notes Requirements (Default — no discussion needed)

- File naming: Recommended to match SVG names (`01_cover.svg` → `notes/01_cover.md`), also compatible with `notes/slide01.md`
- Fill in the Design Spec: total presentation duration, notes style (formal / conversational / interactive), presentation purpose (inform / persuade / inspire / instruct / report)
- Split note files must NOT contain `#` heading lines (`notes/total.md` master document MUST use `#` heading lines)

---

## 2. Mode & Visual-Style Catalogs (Reference for Confirmation Item d)

Confirmation `d` locks two independent catalog items:

- **Mode** — narrative skeleton: [`modes/_index.md`](./modes/_index.md) → `pyramid` / `narrative` / `instructional` / `showcase` / `briefing`.
- **Visual style** — aesthetic: [`visual-styles/_index.md`](./visual-styles/_index.md) → presets + `custom`.

Read the relevant `_index.md` at confirmation `d` (Layer 1 / Layer 2) for its catalog table and auto-selection. Executor loads one locked file per preset, or every exact custom reference before applying its behavior (see [`generate-pptx`](../workflows/generate-pptx.md) Step 6).

---

## 3. Color Selection Reference

Do not start from a universal palette. Precedence is user / brand → active template → project-specific proposal; `scripts/config.py` industry anchors are optional recall. Keep body-text contrast at least 4.5:1; color count and distribution follow encoding, style, and natural assets, not a quota.

Lock the stable role set the deck needs, including recurring neutrals such as `surface`, `grid`, `scrim`, `overlay`, or `block-shade`. These are identity anchors, not an exhaustive paint list. Executor may derive tints, shades, alpha, gradients, and effects, preserve necessary natural asset colors, and add sparse page-local accents for differentiation or ornament. Such accents must not form a competing/recurring palette; Strategist owns reusable positive / warning / negative roles.

---

## 4. Layout Pattern Library

**Proportion follows information weight, not preset ratios.** Choose or combine the smallest structure that expresses the relationship; break the grid for a genuine `breathing` page. Repeating symmetric card grids is a failure mode.

| Content relationship | Useful starting structure |
|---|---|
| One focal claim | centered single column, negative space, or full-bleed + floating text |
| Equal comparison | symmetric split or a true matrix |
| Dominant evidence + takeaway | asymmetric split, typically 3:7 or 2:8 |
| Parallel sequence | three-column, process line, or Z-pattern |
| Core + surrounding forces | center-radiating or hub-spoke |
| Wide visual + explanation | top-bottom split |

On PPT 16:9, start from a 1200×640 safe area with 40px outer margins, then adapt to content. Template workspaces may supply different geometry; when active, [`strategist-template.md`](./strategist-template.md) owns precedence.

---

## 5. Template Flexibility Principle

Free-design patterns are starting points, not quotas. Adjust composition, spacing, and role sizes to the confirmed reading mode, page rhythm, and content. When a template workspace is active, do not reinterpret its reuse contract here; load [`strategist-template.md`](./strategist-template.md).

## 6. Workflow & Deliverables

### 6.1 Content Planning Strategy

Content-outline and speaker-notes strategy follow the deck's locked **mode** — see [`modes/_index.md`](./modes/_index.md), then the locked preset file or every listed custom reference plus its behavior. The guidance below applies within any mode:

**Reading mode controls information carriage, not communication intent.** `result.json delivery_purpose` is retained as the compatibility key for `text` (read-close) / `balanced` (business, default) / `presentation`, confirmed with the complete deck solution in Stage 2. It decides how meaning is divided among the page, visuals, presenter, and notes. The body baseline (§g) is one consequence, not the definition:

| Reading mode | Primary carrier | §IX page grammar | Granularity / rhythm | Speaker notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `text` · read-close | page / document | complete assertions, short prose paragraphs, captions, tables, and necessary detail; bullets only for genuinely parallel or ordered items | fewer, fuller pages; leans `dense` | supplemental context, not a substitute for missing page logic |
| `balanced` · business (default) | page + presenter | one primary claim with concise explanation, structured evidence, or a necessary list | moderate granularity; mixed rhythm | interpretation and transitions |
| `presentation` | presenter + visuals | one claim per page, keywords / short phrases, a large visual or hero number; no paragraph dumps or prose compressed into bullet fragments | more, sparser pages; leans `anchor` / `breathing` | carries explanation, transitions, and supporting detail |

**Recommendation signals**: derive the initial reading mode from the confirmed `audience`, `delivery_context`, and `artifact_afterlife`. Asynchronous review, reference, approval, audit, and leave-behind use lean `text`; presenter-led projection, large-room delivery, launch, or classroom explanation lean `presentation`; hybrid review / roadshow use leans `balanced`. When live projection and durable afterlife both matter, recommend `balanced` unless the contract clearly prioritizes one. If the user confirms `presentation`, support afterlife through notes, appendix pages, captions, and visible sources instead of crowding every slide.

**Per-block expression**: let the semantic relationship choose the form. Causal explanation, argument, interpretation, and narrative continuity use prose. Truly parallel, ordered, or enumerable items may use bullets / numbers. Never create bullets merely because copy is long or a template exposes a list slot. In `presentation`, distill one assertion and move its explanation into notes rather than turning every sentence into a fragment. Source texture remains a secondary cue: an article / transcript / talk leans prose, while a data sheet or inventory may lean structured labels. Write complete, usable phrasing into §IX; do not leave skeletons for Executor. It is preferred wording unless literal preservation applies; Executor owns faithful expression adaptation under [`executor-base.md`](./executor-base.md) §2.1's content-vs-expression contract.

This is what makes the axis meaningful: a `presentation` deck and a `text` deck built from the **same source and communication contract** must differ in page grammar, page count recommendation, per-page text volume, visual burden, layout density, rhythm, and notes—not only in font size. Page count stays the user's call; reading mode informs the recommendation when the user has not fixed one. Record it as **Reading Mode** in `design_spec.md §I` (compatibility key `delivery_purpose`, lock key `consumption_mode`). Separately, `communication_intent` / `audience_outcome` determine what the outline must accomplish, while `delivery_context` and `artifact_afterlife` help select the reading mode and still remain independent constraints after selection. The `page_rhythm` leans are a bias, not a quota. Preservation paths keep source wording and structure verbatim: honor reading mode only in styling and notes, never by rephrasing or re-paginating.

> Note: §IX is the complete page brief; Executor retains it with the lock until context invalidation, then reloads both once.

### 6.2 Planning Artifact Content

Generate Step 4 owns this sequence. `design_spec.md` is the complete human-readable decision; `spec_lock.md` is its context-selected execution subset/routing contract. Consume `result.json` once into the initial Design Spec and never reopen it for the lock. Refinement edits that same Design Spec; affected user revisions become the latest authority. Never treat the planning files as parallel interpretations.

1. Use the retained complete final-confirmation state already read once by Generate Step 4, then read `templates/design_spec_reference.md`.
2. Compose the whole Design Spec in active context before touching the target path. Create `design_spec.md` once from the schema marker through §X; do not copy a scaffold into the project or patch placeholder fields. Record production mechanics in §I. In §IX, create the complete ordered roster; each entry carries layout, title, core message, **Audience move**, complete preferred wording, applicable capability recommendations, visualization/image references, sourced `Fact IDs`, and `Data class: scenario` for invented demo data. After Gate 1 plus conditional refine approval, roster ids/count/order and semantic content are authoritative; non-literal wording, block texture, layout, cover/closing composition, capability recommendations, and image/chart patterns remain References unless promoted.
3. Compare `design_spec.md` against the final confirmation field by field. Repair every omission or deviation before entering an enabled refine-spec review or authoring `spec_lock.md`.
4. If enabled, run [`refine-spec`](../workflows/stages/refine-spec.md) after Gate 1; edit only that Design Spec and create no lock before explicit approval.
5. Read `templates/spec_lock_reference.md`. From the approved Design Spec plus context, create the lock once or resynchronize stale derived state. Retain identity/refinements, select stable roles/routing, omit unnamed page-local values, and do not reopen evidence. This is implementation judgment, not another recommendation.

**Final confirmation → Design Spec consumption map**:

| Confirmed state | Required Design Spec realization |
|---|---|
| Communication contract and `content_divergence` | §I records the confirmed contract; §IX realizes every stated purpose, outcome, priority, and source-treatment constraint |
| Canvas, reading mode, and page count | §I records the confirmed input and exact resolved count; §IX contains that many ordered pages. Executor produces exactly one output slide per entry, in order |
| Mode, visual style, palette, and generated-image rendering | §I and §III record the selected direction as identity anchors; named core roles stay stable while page-local expression remains contextual |
| Typography, including Strategist-derived recurring family overrides and every visible role size | §IV records the confirmed heading/body stacks, any recurring support-role stacks justified by §IX, and exact `body`, `title`, `subtitle`, and `annotation` anchor values; never discard a declared role override or re-derive a confirmed anchor |
| Icons | §VI uses the confirmed library or confirmed no-icon/custom path |
| Confirmed image-source set, `image_notes`, and AI strategy | §VIII uses only permitted sources and includes every explicitly required source, asset, or page role; a permitted but unused source needs no row |
| Natural-language template application | §I records it and the relevant layout/prototype choices realize it without silently dropping a requested use or exclusion |
| Formula policy, AI-image acquisition path, generation mode, refine-spec toggle | §I records them as production mechanics; their owning Generate stage consumes the Design Spec, and formula policy also shapes §VIII when formula-worthy content exists |

⛔ **GATE 1 — active-decision fidelity.** Do not create `spec_lock.md` until the initial Design Spec passes the comparison above and any enabled refinement is explicitly approved. Before Gate 2, every requested revision must be present and every unaffected decision intact. Missing/substituted values, unapplied revisions, or silently changed semantic types block despite schema validity; bounded Reference adaptation and unused Permission remain valid.

⛔ **GATE 2 — lock context fidelity.** After Gate 1 closes, author machine-relevant anchors/routing into `spec_lock.md`. The lock may normalize syntax and add justified recurring roles, but must not change identity, discard a refinement, introduce a direction, or become a field copy/allowlist. On contradiction, return to Gate 1 using retained confirmation by default or the approved revised Design Spec after refinement; fresh recovery reads persisted final evidence once only when active state is absent.

**Execution lock content**: `spec_lock.md` compactly carries communication, stable color/type anchors, icons, images, page rhythm, chart choices, and route-specific PowerPoint structure. Name every recurring typography role; a planned short non-structural Hero/Display size may stay omitted only while the same value appears at most twice, and its third occurrence requires a named role. Never re-derive a confirmed anchor. New locks keep `font_family` as the body/default compatibility stack and also write explicit `title_family` + `body_family`; every additional recurring Design Spec role projects to `<role>_family`. Collapsing distinct Design Spec stacks into `font_family`, or dropping an extra role, fails Gate 2. Keep core fonts/palette roles stable; page authoring varies treatment and may add sparse local garnish. Project every placed §VIII image's source, preferred-pattern reference, and crop policy; omit unplaced sheets and planning provenance. Free-design, brand-only, and `template_reuse_scope: style` use `pptx_structure.mode: flat`; the template module owns structured mappings. Executor context policy lives in [executor-base.md](executor-base.md) §2.1. Repair from Gate 2's active decision authority, then re-author affected lock rows.

**Contextual extension**: derived paint or sparse local font/color garnish may stay in one SVG while non-structural and non-recurring. New base/semantic colors, structural/recurring fonts, resources, or recurring cross-page identity patterns require upstream repair; a page-local §VIII preferred image pattern follows [`executor-image.md`](./executor-image.md) and may change during realization. Executor never reverse-projects a local choice as planning fact. Promote recurring garnish upstream before reuse, read back and validate the affected planning fragments, and never add values to silence a comparison.

   - **Communication trace is mandatory**: Keep the full confirmed communication contract in `design_spec.md §I`, then project only `audience`, `objective`, `core_message`, and canonical `consumption_mode` into `spec_lock.md communication`. Write `objective` as one concise execution sentence that preserves both the confirmed `communication_intent` and the success condition in `audience_outcome`; do not copy `delivery_context`, `artifact_afterlife`, dates, provenance, or conflict-resolution commentary into the lock. Before finalizing §IX, check that every named purpose has at least one outline obligation and **every Slide block**, including cover / divider / closing pages, has an `Audience move` that advances the global outcome. A page that advances no purpose or outcome should be merged, rewritten, or cut. `project_manager.py validate` and `svg_quality_checker.py` enforce the compact lock fields and per-page move presence, not their subjective quality.
   - **Custom behavior is concise and executable**: For confirmed `custom` mode or visual style, project one resolved `mode_behavior` / `visual_style_behavior` sentence or short paragraph. When the direction actually combines or borrows catalog entries, also project the exact, comma-separated `mode_references` / `visual_style_references`; omit the field for a genuinely novel direction and never fabricate a nearby reference. Preserve the confirmed direction, reference locked role names such as `colors.primary` when needed, and omit selection history, contradictions, precedence explanations, or other Design Spec provenance. Executor reads these fields from the retained lock and loads every referenced catalog entry once per valid context.
   - **page_rhythm is mandatory**: Based on the page list in §IX Content Outline, assign each page one of `anchor` / `dense` / `breathing`. This is what breaks the uniform "every page is a card grid" feel. New locks may not omit the section; consumer omission behavior is owned by [`executor-base.md`](executor-base.md) §2.1.
   - **Fact IDs and scenario labels are mandatory when applicable**: Read any `sources/*.facts.json`. For each §IX page, list the stable IDs actually used; never cite an ID whose claim is absent from the page. Mark invented KPIs/targets/internal ratios as `Data class: scenario` and state which values are scenario data. Executor carries external sources into notes/footnotes and renders a visible scenario label for scenario figures.
   - **Rhythm follows narrative, not quota**: `breathing` pages mark natural pauses — chapter transitions, standalone emphasis (hero quote / big number), SCQA bridges. Dense decks may legitimately be all `dense`. **Do NOT invent filler pages** ("Thank you", empty dividers) to pad rhythm — every `breathing` page must say something independent. Consumption mode biases the overall lean (`presentation` toward more `anchor` / `breathing`, `text` toward `dense`; see §6.1) — a bias, never a quota.
   - **Cover impact is mandatory**: Page `P01` is the deck's first visual contract, not a generic title slide. In `design_spec.md §IX`, add a `Cover impact` line for `P01` that names one concrete hook and one concrete composition strategy. Use the source's strongest available signal: a provocative core claim, object / scene metaphor, hero number, founder / product / audience moment, or a distilled conflict. Pair it with one concrete composition strategy — such as `full-bleed image + floating title`, `typographic poster`, `hero object`, `data hook`, `editorial scene`, `high-contrast abstract geometry`, or a fresh composition the deck's subject suggests (these are starting points, not the allowed set). If no external or AI image is available, still specify a native-SVG visual hook; do not fall back to "title + subtitle + decorative background". (Beautify / template-fill keep the source cover verbatim — this rule does not apply on those preservation paths.)
   - **Cover rhythm lock**: `P01` remains `anchor` in `spec_lock.md page_rhythm`, but its §IX `Cover impact` must prevent content-page patterns. Do not plan multi-card grids, agenda-like bullets, or equal-weight columns on the cover unless a template explicitly requires that structure, or a preservation path (beautify / template-fill) is transcribing the source cover verbatim.
   - **Closing impact (only when the deck closes)**: the deck's last page is its final visual contract — the strongest impression after the cover. When the deck genuinely lands on a conclusion / call-to-action / final-takeaway page, give it a `Closing impact` line in §IX: name the one thing the audience should leave with (a distilled takeaway, a forward call, a memorable restatement of the core claim) + one composition that delivers it — never a generic "Thank you" / contact-only slide or a centered-title reprise of the cover. **Do NOT invent a closing page to satisfy this** — the filler-page ban above still holds; apply it only to the page where the deck actually resolves. Same exemptions as the cover: skip on template / beautify / template-fill preservation paths.
   - **pptx_structure is mandatory**: Free-design, brand-only, and `template_reuse_scope: style` routes write `mode: flat`; a style-reference route may also record `template_reuse_scope: style` but omits every structure mapping and `template_adherence`. `template_reuse_scope: mirror|layout` writes `mode: structured` plus `template_adherence: strict|adaptive`. Do not write legacy `baseline`, `template`, `preserve`, `layout_strategy`, or Layout-kind rows into a new project.
   - **Flat-route boundary**: With `mode: flat`, omit `pptx_masters`, `pptx_layouts`, `page_pptx_layouts`, and `page_layouts`. Do not plan native Master/Layout families or reusable placeholder slots. Every generated SVG object remains Slide-local: omit root Master/Layout identity, `data-pptx-layer`, and `data-pptx-placeholder*` metadata. Export materializes one clean project-owned Master plus one Blank Layout from the current color/typography lock, removes stock content placeholders/Layout inventory, and retains only the standard date/footer/slide-number capability hooks.
   - **Structured template route**: When [`strategist-template.md`](./strategist-template.md) is active and reuse is `mirror|layout`, follow its complete Master/Layout/slot/prototype mapping rules.
   - **page_charts**: project each §VII row's `Page` and `Template` as `P<NN>: <template_key>`; Usage stays in the Design Spec. This is a page-local reference, not a type/geometry lock. Omit no-match pages and the empty section.

## 7. Project Boundary

The Generate route owns project initialization and supplies `<project_path>`. Strategist writes only the two complete planning artifacts at that root plus the explicitly triggered resource manifests; it does not choose or create another project path.

---

## 8. Handoff

After validation, return to the Generate Step 4 checkpoint. The route—not this role—owns whether Step 5 runs and how execution resumes or auto-proceeds.
