# Image Acquisition Common Reference

Shared baseline for both acquisition paths. Path-specific behavior lives in the path's own reference.

---

## 1. Trigger Condition

Active when at least one resource row has `Acquire Via: ai` / `web` / `slice`. Rows with `user` / `formula` / `placeholder` are tracked but skipped by these acquisition roles.

| Mode | Trigger |
|---|---|
| Default Generate | `generate-ppt` workflow, `design_spec.md §VIII` image rows present |
| Quick Generate | [`quick-generate`](../workflows/profiles/quick-generate.md) is active and its transient resource roster contains image rows |
| Standalone | Direct request against an existing project |

---

## 2. Image Resource List Format

Default Generate uses Strategist-owned `design_spec.md §VIII` plus its lock projection. Quick Generate substitutes a transient active-context roster; it creates neither planning artifact. Status enum: [`svg-image-embedding.md`](svg-image-embedding.md).

| Filename | Dimensions | Purpose / Type | Layout pattern | Crop Policy | Acquire Via | Status | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `<planned file>` | `<planned size>` | `<planned role>` | `<owner-resolved recommendation>` | `adaptive` / `no-crop` | `ai` / `web` / `slice` | Pending | `<acquisition brief>` |

**Required per non-skipped row**: `Acquire Via` and `Status`. `Reference` is required for every `web` / `slice` row and every newly authored `ai` row. An existing `ai` row whose `Reference` is omitted or blank may continue only through the declared inference in [`image-generator.md`](./image-generator.md) §8; no other path may infer it.

**Quick Generate ownership**: explicit user assets, URLs, and path instructions win. Otherwise the main agent chooses required `user` / `ai` / `web` / `slice` / `formula` rows and AI path `auto`, without interaction.

---

## 3. Path Dispatch

For each row with `Status: Pending`:

| Acquire Via | Load reference | Run | Success status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ai` | [`image-generator.md`](./image-generator.md) | `image_gen.py` | `Generated` |
| `web` | [`image-searcher.md`](./image-searcher.md) | `image_search.py` | `Sourced` |
| `slice` | [`image-generator.md`](./image-generator.md) §4.3 | `slice_images.py` after parent AI sheet is `Generated` | `Generated` |
| `user` | — | — | (already `Existing`) |
| `formula` | — | — | (already `Rendered`) |
| `placeholder` | — | — | (already `Placeholder`) |

> Lazy load: an all-`web` deck never reads `image-generator.md`, and vice versa.

### 3.1 Codex CLI Backend

**Trigger**: Use only when `IMAGE_BACKEND=codex` or `--backend codex` is explicitly selected.

| Requirement | Command / Behavior |
|---|---|
| Install CLI | `npm install -g @openai/codex` |
| Login | `codex login` |
| Backend selection | `IMAGE_BACKEND=codex` |
| Credential model | Uses the logged-in Codex / ChatGPT subscription; no API key is read |
| Aspect ratios | `1:1`, `16:9`, `9:16`, `4:3`, `2.35:1`; `21:9` maps explicitly to `2.35:1` |
| Size / quality | `--image_size`, quality-style settings, and `--model` are ignored with a console note; Codex chooses pixels from aspect ratio |
| Speed | Expect 5-10x direct API latency on uncached runs |
| Output count | One image per Codex backend invocation |

**Hard rule**: Unsupported aspect ratios must fail loudly or map with an explicit console note. Do not silently coerce to a nearby shape.

**Default — manifest pacing (may override for a deliberate queue)**: Use `--concurrency 1` with Codex. The backend serializes in-process `codex exec` calls because Codex CLI image generation is a slow single-image workflow.

## 4. Analysis Phase

Before processing any row:

1. Read the Default Design Spec/lock, or reuse Quick's transient roster and active visual/page decisions
2. Group resource list rows by `Acquire Via`
3. Confirm `project/images/` exists
4. Materialize explicit user assets, render declared formulas, and finish triggered ai/web/slice acquisition before SVG authoring begins

---

## 5. Verification Phase

After all rows reach terminal status:

- Every non-skipped row has a file at `project/images/<filename>`, or is marked `Needs-Manual`
- Every `slice` row has a generated element file, or is marked `Needs-Manual` because its parent sheet is not available
- No `Pending` or `Failed` rows remain
- `image_prompts.json` exists when ≥1 ai row processed; every entry has `status ∈ {Generated, Needs-Manual}` (no `Pending` or `Failed` remaining)
- `image_sources.json` exists when ≥1 web row processed; every entry has `license_tier ∈ {no-attribution, attribution-required, manual}` (`manual` = a user-supplied `--from-url` replacement)

> `Needs-Manual` is terminal for acquisition, not export readiness. A later
> supplied/replaced file must be validated and its row reconciled to
> `Generated`, `Sourced`, or `Rendered` with the matching manifest evidence.
> Quick blocks every required row that still says `Needs-Manual`, regardless of
> whether an unverified candidate file happens to exist. See
> [`image-generator.md`](./image-generator.md) §7.

---

## 6. Failure Handling

**Hard rule — automatic exhaustion before blocking**: acquisition failures MUST NOT open an interactive choice or stop while an untried permitted strategy remains.

1. Run the selected path's initial strategy
2. On recoverable failure (network, no candidates, license rejection, rate limit), continue through materially different strategies that remain inside that path's confirmed permissions; never loop an already exhausted strategy
3. When the path-specific query/provider/license-stage or backend/retry strategy is exhausted, set `Status: Needs-Manual`, log the reason in conversation, and continue
4. After the phase completes, summarize all `Needs-Manual` rows for the user — list filenames, where prompts live (`images/image_prompts.md` paste-ready blocks for ai rows; refresh via `image_gen.py --render-md` if stale), and where to place generated files (`project/images/<filename>`). After supply/replacement, validate the file and reconcile the owning row plus manifest to its usable status. For `slice` rows, list the parent sheet filename and target element names; the user places the sheet, then the agent reruns `slice_images.py`.

**Quick Generate export gate**: exhaust allowed automation without asking; stop
before `--quick-generate` when a required row is not both backed by its
validated file/provenance and in a usable status. File presence alone never
bypasses `Needs-Manual`.

`Needs-Manual` is also the entry status for **Offline Manual Mode** (no `IMAGE_BACKEND` configured, no host-native image tool in use). Affected ai rows are marked `Needs-Manual` from the start without a failed attempt — see [`image-generator.md`](./image-generator.md) §7 Offline Manual Mode.

Path-specific retry policies (provider chain, backend chain) live in the path's own reference.

---

## 7. Credits — Single Source of Truth

License / attribution data lives **only** in `project/images/image_sources.json`.

**Forbidden — credits anywhere else**:

- `notes/*.md` (TTS would speak them in the audio export)
- `total.md` (gets split, then overwritten)
- SVG `<title>` / `<desc>` (stripped by `svg_to_pptx.py`)
- A separate "Image Credits" appendix slide (lost on single-page sharing)

Executor reads the manifest per slide and renders inline credits when needed — see [`executor-web-image.md`](./executor-web-image.md) §1 and [`image-searcher.md`](./image-searcher.md) §7.

---

## 8. Intent Ownership

The `Reference` field is **intent**, not a query. Strategist owns it by default; Quick's main agent owns it in the transient roster. The receiving role translates without reopening it.

| ✅ Intent | ❌ Pre-processed |
|---|---|
| `"Diverse engineering team in modern office, natural light"` | `"team office light"` |
| `"Abstract digital waves, deep navy gradient #0A2540"` | `"use openverse, search 'waves'"` |

---

## 9. Handoff with SVG Authoring

SVG authoring consumes the resource roster plus:

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Image files | `project/images/*.{jpg,png,webp}` | `<image>` references |
| Manifest | `project/images/image_sources.json` | `license_tier` per Sourced image |

**Default Generate boundary**: Executor does NOT invoke `image_gen.py` / `image_search.py` / `slice_images.py`; missing material returns to Strategist-owned preparation.

**Quick Generate boundary**: the main agent finishes acquisition before SVG authoring, then neither acquires nor reselects while drawing.

---

## 10. Task Completion Checkpoint

Verify every row, file, triggered manifest/sidecar, and provenance record.
Default proceeds to Executor. Quick proceeds without interaction after
preparation and exports only when every required row has validated evidence and
a usable status. Report only blocking recovery.
