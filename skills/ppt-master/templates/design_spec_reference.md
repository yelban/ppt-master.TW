# Design Spec Structure

Project-level `design_spec.md` is a human-readable English-heading Markdown artifact. This file owns its normal authoring structure. [`schemas/design_spec.schema.json`](./schemas/design_spec.schema.json) provides structural lint for readable sections and page projection; it is not an execution lock and does not require textual equality with `spec_lock.md`.

Strategist reads the complete final confirmation once, writes this artifact from that retained state plus source analysis, and audits every confirmed field here. Afterward, `spec_lock.md` is authored from the completed Design Spec plus current project/page/template context; normal lock authoring never reopens `result.json`.

## 1. Author the complete artifact

After final confirmation, compose the entire document in active context from the retained final state, source analysis, and project context. Then create `<project_path>/design_spec.md` once, from the first line through §X.

**Mandatory — new-project write**: The first non-empty line is exactly `<!-- ppt-master-schema: design-spec/v1 -->`, followed by `# <Project Name> - Design Spec`. Write every required section with final values and the complete page roster; include conditional §VII only when a real catalog reference is selected. Do not create a placeholder-bearing project file, copy example rows, or patch a scaffold field by field.

`project_manager.py scaffold-spec` remains an optional manual convenience and overwrite-safe troubleshooting tool. It is not part of normal Generate authoring. Resume and refine paths edit an existing completed Design Spec rather than replacing it with a scaffold.

## 2. Exact document contract

Angle-bracketed text below is authoring notation, not project content. Resolve every universal value before writing the file; omit only rows explicitly marked conditional. Keep every required `##` heading; omit §VII when no real catalog reference is selected, while §VIII remains present even with no data rows. Do not copy examples, notation tokens, or a second schema description into the project artifact.

### 2.1 Header and project contract

Start with this exact heading order:

```markdown
<!-- ppt-master-schema: design-spec/v1 -->
# <Project Name> - Design Spec

## I. Project Information

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Project Name | <resolved project name> |
| Canvas Format | <canonical format and dimensions> |
| Page Count | <exact final count matching §IX> |
| Target Audience | <confirmed audience> |
| Communication Intent | <confirmed intent, including priority or sequence> |
| Desired Audience Outcome | <confirmed observable outcome> |
| Core Message / Ask / Action | <confirmed core message or ask> |
| Delivery Context | <confirmed delivery context> |
| Artifact Afterlife | <confirmed afterlife> |
| Reading Mode | <text, balanced, presentation, or the active non-PPT equivalent> |
| Content Strategy | <confirmed material-divergence prose or balanced default> |
| Design Style | <resolved design direction> |
| Formula Policy | <mixed, render-all, or text-only> |
| AI Image Acquisition Path | <confirmed path or not applicable> |
| Generation Mode | <continuous or split> |
| Spec Refinement | <enabled or disabled> |
| Created Date | <YYYY-MM-DD> |

## II. Canvas Specification

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Format | <canonical format name> |
| Dimensions | <width × height> |
| viewBox | `<exact viewBox>` |
| Margins | <safe margins> |
| Content Area | <usable bounds> |
```

When a template workspace is active, append exactly one line after the §I table: `- **Template Application**: <confirmed or Strategist-resolved natural-language plan>`. Omit it for free design. Never replace this prose with internal reuse/adherence ids.

### 2.2 Visual, typography, layout, and icons

Use these exact subsections and field shapes:

```markdown
## III. Visual Theme

### Theme Style

- **Mode**: <confirmed preset or custom>
- **Visual style**: <confirmed preset or custom>
- **Theme**: <resolved identity direction>
- **Tone**: <resolved tone>

### Color Scheme

| Role | HEX | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Background | <HEX> | <semantic use> |
| Secondary background | <HEX> | <semantic use> |
| Primary | <HEX> | <semantic use> |
| Accent | <HEX> | <semantic use> |
| Secondary accent | <HEX> | <semantic use> |
| Body text | <HEX> | <semantic use> |

## IV. Typography System

### Font Plan

| Role | Chinese | English | Fallback tail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Title | <family> | <family> | <fallback> |
| Body | <family> | <family> | <fallback> |

- **Title stack**: <complete ordered stack>
- **Body stack**: <complete ordered stack>

### Font Size Hierarchy

| Purpose | Anchor Size (px) |
| --- | ---: |
| Body | <confirmed value> |
| Title | <confirmed value> |
| Subtitle | <confirmed value> |
| Annotation | <confirmed value> |

## V. Layout Principles

### Page Structure

- **Header area**: <rule>
- **Content area**: <rule>
- **Footer area**: <rule>

### Spacing Specification

| Element | Current Project |
| --- | --- |
| Safe margin | <value> |
| Content block gap | <value> |
| Icon-text gap | <value> |

## VI. Icon Usage Specification

- **Primary bundled library**: <one of chunk-filled / tabler-filled / tabler-outline / phosphor-duotone, or none>
- **Brand-logo library**: <simple-icons when selected for real brand marks; omit otherwise>

| Purpose | Icon Path | Page |
| --- | --- | --- |
```

Preserve the confirmed Title/Body system, then add every Strategist-established recurring family override justified by the completed page plan. Append the same semantic role to the Font Plan table and add `- **<Role> stack**: <complete ordered stack>`. Typical optional roles include `Annotation`, `Footer`, `Footnote`, `Data`, `Emphasis`, `Quote`, and `Code`; add only roles that recur and intentionally differ. Add one compact `Role rationale` only when at least one such override is declared; otherwise omit it. The rationale does not become a lock field. Do not collapse distinct Title/Body stacks or discard a declared optional role. Treat every Font Size Hierarchy value as a role anchor: Executor may adjust one occurrence within anchor `±2px`; a short non-structural Hero/Display size may stay unlisted only while the same value is planned at most twice, and its third occurrence needs a named row. Add every recurring palette role and typography-size anchor established by the plan; do not enumerate one-off paint or font-family garnish. For confirmed custom directions, add the applicable `Mode References`, `Mode Behavior`, `Visual Style References`, and `Visual Style Behavior` lines under Theme Style. Include `Stroke Width` under §VI only for a stroke library. `simple-icons` may accompany the one primary bundled library and is recorded only when real brand marks were selected. The icon table records planned usage, but user-provided, template-carried, imported, custom, and other prepared SVGs under the project `icons/` directory remain usable without being forced into that stylistic selection. Leave the §VI table empty when no icons are used.

When §VIII contains any `Acquire Via: ai` row, add this subsection under §III and preserve the complete confirmed AI direction:

```markdown
### AI Image Strategy

- **Image Rendering**: <confirmed preset or custom>
- **Visual**: <confirmed visual treatment>
- **Mood**: <confirmed mood and analogy>
```

For a selected custom rendering, also add `Image Rendering Behavior`; add `Image Rendering References` only when the confirmed custom direction actually uses catalog material. Never add a separate image palette.

### 2.3 Visualization and image resources

Use the §VII table only when at least one real catalog reference is selected. Always keep the §VIII table, including when it has no data rows:

```markdown
## VII. Visualization Reference List

| Page | Template | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |

## VIII. Image Resource List

| Filename | Dimensions | Ratio | Purpose | Type | Layout pattern | Crop Policy | Acquire Via | Status | Reference | text_policy | page_role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

§VII is an optional page-local reference list. Each row records the page, catalog key, and a short semantic Usage—not geometry. The key derives `templates/charts/<key>.svg`; §IX remains authoritative over final type and realization. Omit an empty §VII and never add path, summary, runners-up, `no-template-match`, or `n/a`. Put unmatched fallbacks in §IX. Legacy wider rows remain readable; new specs use these three columns.

For every independent data chart or pure text-grid table, add `- **Native-ready**: yes|no` to its §IX Slide block. Choose `yes` only when the confirmed requirement or artifact afterlife benefits from an editable native data object; otherwise use `no`. Conceptual visualizations and incidental sparklines, KPI trends, or insets omit this field and remain ordinary SVG.

In §VIII, author every planned or explicitly required resource from the confirmed source boundary. Copy the recommended `Layout pattern` id/name and modifiers verbatim as a preferred composition; set `Crop Policy` to `adaptive` or `no-crop`; set `Acquire Via` to `ai`, `web`, `user`, `formula`, `placeholder`, or `slice`. Preserve unresolved required assets as `Pending` or `Needs-Manual` instead of dropping or reclassifying them.

§VIII `Layout pattern` is a per-resource preference. When a page uses several images, repeats one image in multiple views, or combines an image with native overlays, describe the page-level relationship and participating resources in §IX `Layout` / `Images`; do not duplicate an unchanged resource row merely to encode animation sequencing.

### 2.4 Complete page roster and notes

Write one ordered Slide block per page. Slide count and order must equal §I `Page Count`; `Content` is a complete page brief, not a skeleton.

```markdown
## IX. Content Outline

### Part 1: <section name>

#### Slide 01 - <page name>

- **Audience move**: <audience state before → after>
- **Layout**: <composition; include the chosen prototype when template-active>
- **Title**: <preferred page title>
- **Core message**: <one governing assertion>
- **Content**: <complete intended on-slide content and hierarchy>

## X. Speaker Notes Requirements

- **Filename**: match each SVG filename under `notes/`
- **Content**: <notes content and source-handling policy>
- **Total duration**: <resolved duration>
- **Notes style**: <formal, conversational, interactive, or resolved equivalent>
- **Presentation purpose**: <inform, persuade, inspire, instruct, report, or resolved combination>
```

Append either or both optional lines only when the capability earns a place;
never write an empty or `none` placeholder:

```markdown
- **Native shape suggestion**: <semantic object/result plus candidate preset/Connector family or Boolean operation/operand roles>
- **Motion suggestion**: <communication job plus desired page-entry or reveal relationship/order>
```

Add `Visualization` and `Images` to a Slide block when it consumes §VII/§VIII rows or uses a page-local visualization. State whether `Visualization` is data-driven when source values determine geometry; this page-level declaration remains authoritative even when no catalog reference fits. Add `Native shape suggestion` only when a literal PowerPoint preset, a stock bent/curved Connector contour, or a compound silhouette/cutout/intersection/fragment may strengthen the page; describe the semantic object/result and candidate family or Boolean operation/operands, not coordinates, paths, exact preset keys, endpoint/site metadata, or attachment promises. Executor chooses the actual basic primitive, preset, Boolean construction, or necessary freeform. Add `Motion suggestion` only when a page transition or progressive reveal would strengthen communication; describe its purpose and semantic order/relationship in natural language, not registry keys, Effect Options, durations, group ids, or coverage. When it depends on visible image states, describe those fully revealed units in the same page's `Layout` / `Images`; the suggestion does not create missing visual content. It remains a recommendation: Executor owns the exact native behavior and may simplify it or choose no motion unless that would violate an explicit user requirement. Add `Native-ready: yes|no` only for independent data charts or pure text-grid tables. Add `Fact IDs` for sourced claims and `Data class: scenario` for invented demo values. Add `Cover impact` to P01 except on preservation paths; add `Closing impact` only when the final page genuinely resolves the deck. Roster ids/count/order and final content are authoritative. §VIII image patterns are preferred composition references; chart rows only offer page-local references. Executor owns geometry, hierarchy, treatment, and sparse local garnish.

For free-design pages, describe `Layout` through relationships, hierarchy, regions, and column spans; do not prescribe element-level `x`, `y`, `width`, or `height` or duplicate the global geometry in §II/§V. Exact coordinates belong to Executor SVG authoring. Preserve literal geometry only when the user explicitly requires it or a mirror/template preservation contract owns it.

## 3. Machine validation

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/project_manager.py validate <project_path>
```

Validation reads the Markdown directly. It reports missing or out-of-order I–X sections, unresolved `[fill...]` placeholders, missing per-slide `Audience move`, and a missing §III `AI Image Strategy` when an §VIII table selects `ai` acquisition.

The schema validates structure only. Strategist role modules own field meaning, recommendation logic, page planning, image policy, and template policy. `spec_lock.md` owns stable execution anchors and routing selected in context; it is not an exhaustive value projection. On divergence, repair the Design Spec from the retained final state when Gate 1 fails, then re-author affected lock anchors from the audited Design Spec and current context. Never reopen `result.json` merely to author or validate the lock, and never use the lock to overwrite a valid Design Spec decision.
