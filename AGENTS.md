# AGENTS.md

This file is the project entry point for general AI agents.

**You MUST read [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) before any PPT generation task or repo modification.** It owns global execution discipline and points to the route selector; after routing, the selected route authority owns its steps, gates, and commands. The rest of this file only points to where related material lives.

## Project Overview

PPT Master turns source material into natively editable DrawingML PPTX. Generate owns the default Strategist → Image_Generator → Executor pipeline and an explicit Quick profile without a separate strategy/confirmation phase.

**Route selection authority**: [`skills/ppt-master/workflows/routing.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/routing.md) owns the four top-level artifact routes: Generate PPTX, Create Template, Fill Native PPTX, and Enhance Native PPTX. Child workflows, profiles, stages, and governance documents refine one selected route; they are not competing top-level routes.

- Topic-only or fact-insufficient inputs run [`topic-research`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/topic-research.md) in Generate Step 1; facts only, no images.
- Raw PPTX template plus new material/topic routes to [`template-fill-pptx`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/template-fill-pptx.md), not the SVG pipeline.
- Raw PPTX cannot be consumed as a Generate Step 3 SVG template; run [`create-template`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md) first and return with the generated template workspace root. Never add Master/Layout structure directly to an existing PPTX/SVG; generate new structured SVG pages from the workspace.
- Explicit quick/fast or skip-strategy generation may use [`quick-generate`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/profiles/quick-generate.md): prepare sources/resources as needed, decide without interaction, omit Strategist/confirmation/spec/lock, hand-author `svg_output/`, pass its lockless final checker, and export.
- PPTX beautify is a strict 1:1 main-generation [`profile`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/profiles/beautify-pptx.md), not a separate route; any split/merge/drop/reorder uses the default main-pipeline policy.
- Finished PPTX native enhancement uses [`native-enhance-pptx`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/native-enhance-pptx.md) and must not enter SVG regeneration.
- [`visual-review`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/visual-review.md), [`customize-animations`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/customize-animations.md), and [`generate-audio`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/stages/generate-audio.md) are supporting stages; their trigger rules remain explicit/conditional.

## Execution Requirements

- For any `brand`, `layout`, or `deck` workspace creation from PPTX/SVG, images/PDFs, documents/websites, brand assets, direct text, or mixed references, enter [`skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template.md); it keeps the fixed Create Template name and dispatches exactly one of [`create-brand`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template/create-brand.md), [`create-layout`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template/create-layout.md), or [`create-deck`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/create-template/create-deck.md).
- Always-on SVG constraints live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards-core.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/shared-standards-core.md). Load [`svg-effects.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/svg-effects.md), [`native-data-interface.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/native-data-interface.md), and [`pptx-structure-interface.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/pptx-structure-interface.md) only when their documented execution triggers apply.
- Canvas choices live in [`skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md`](skills/ppt-master/references/canvas-formats.md).
- Icon library details live in [`skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md`](skills/ppt-master/templates/icons/README.md).

## Required Conventions

- **Repo-wide style rules** — when editing prompt files under [`skills/ppt-master/references/`](skills/ppt-master/references/), Python under [`skills/ppt-master/scripts/`](skills/ppt-master/scripts/), or any other code/prose in the repo, follow the matching style rule in [`docs/rules/`](docs/rules/).
- **Prompt decision ownership** — follow [`docs/rules/prompt-style.md`](docs/rules/prompt-style.md) §4.1. Default Strategist prepares project-local resources and Executor realizes them; Quick's current agent decides and prepares before SVG authoring. This is not downstream acquisition. Every project icon is prepared material; `icons.inventory` records only the default plan's bundled selection.
- **Markdown language consistency** — Markdown files under `skills/ppt-master/workflows/`, `skills/ppt-master/references/`, and `docs/` are currently single-language per directory. New files mirror the language of their siblings; do not mix English scaffolding with Chinese paragraphs (or vice versa) inside one file. Chat replies are unaffected.

## Compatibility Boundary

- This repository is a workflow/skill package, not an app or service scaffold.
- Do NOT assume generic-project conventions like `.worktrees/`, `tests/`, or mandatory branch setup unless the user explicitly requests them.
- On conflict with a generic coding skill, prioritize [`skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md) inside this repository.

## Command Quick Reference

Convenience summary only — route selection starts in [`SKILL.md`](skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md); the full SVG-generation workflow is [`generate-pptx.md`](skills/ppt-master/workflows/generate-pptx.md).
